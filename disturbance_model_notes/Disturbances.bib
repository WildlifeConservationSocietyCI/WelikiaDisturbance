To understand the lingering consequences of human history on current ecosystems and landscapes, and conversely to understand the role that changing environments have played in human history, the author urges an interdisciplinary approach. Different disciplines working together can develop information that none alone can provide. History matters for all manner of ecological and environmental studies, both theoretical and applied, says Russell, and integration of these disciplines can assist us in dealing responsibly with our role in the biosphere."--Jacket.},

This article argues that the degree to which incipient maize horticulture entailed shifts in social complexity has not been well-defined by researchers. Minimally, introduction of maize into traditional economies gave rise to comparatively more complex relationships between resident late prehistoric groups and local environmental regimes. A gradually increasing commitment to economic systems which included maize and other seed-bearing plants led to increased levels of complexity in labor organization and land-use practices. Changing perceptions of cultural “belongingness,” prompted by competition for lands suitable for cultivation, influenced how local groups conceived and expressed intra-and intergroup sociopolitical identities. Such shifts in perceptions of sociopolitical differences in late prehistory are traceable in ideological structures reflected in mortuary patterning represented in the regional archaeological record.},

	abstract = {Recent declines in the amount of habitat suitable for early successional wildlife in the northeastern US have prompted public land managers to consider establishing minimum levels of young forest, based on the natural range of variation, in order to maintain viable populations of these species. In this paper, we review evidence on the frequency, severity, and scale of natural disturbances in four major forest regions of the northeastern US. Using six independent lines of evidence, we examined the influence of natural disturbances in presettlement and modern times. In situations where estimates of annual disturbance rates were available, we estimated the regional age distribution of forest stands based on the assumption of random spatial pattern of disturbance. Available evidence suggests a gradient of generally decreasing disturbance frequency from coastal regions to the interior uplands and mountains. The proportion of the presettlement landscape in seedling–sapling forest habitat (1–15 years old) ranged from 1 to 3\% in northern hardwood forests (Fagus–Betula–Acer–Tsuga) of the interior uplands to possibly \&gt;10\% in coastal pine–oak (Pinus–Quercus) barrens. Within a region, variability in the amount of young forest is not well known, but upper slopes and ridges generally had the highest disturbance frequency and severity. Comparison of line transect data of the presettlement land surveys with modern plot surveys suggests that present-day amounts of young forests in northern hardwood and spruce–hardwood forests in some regions may be several times higher than in presettlement times. In coastal oak forests and pine–oak barrens, the amount of young forests and open woodlands may be less because of reduced fire frequency.},

Numerous plant communities depend on fire to generate species diversity in both time and space. Without fire such ecosystems would become sterile monocultures. Recent efforts to prohibit fire in fire dependent communities have contributed to more intense and more damaging fires. For these reasons, foresters, ecologists, land managers, geographers, and environmental scientists are interested in the behavior and ecological effects of fires. This book will be the first to focus on the chemistry and physics of fire as it relates to the ways in which fire behaves and the impacts it has on ecosystem function. Leading international contributors have been recruited by the editors to prepare a didactic text/reference that will appeal to both advanced students and practicing professionals.},

While much information was lost to postharvest fire and stump deterioration, 147 fire-free intervals revealed in cross-sections from 29 coastal sand patches document numerous close interval surface fires before 1910; only one post-1910 fire was documented. Cross-sections from the 10 patches with records spanning {\textgreater}150 yr suggest local fire occurrence rates before 1910 ca. 10 times the present rate of lightning-caused fire. Since fire spread between or into coastal sand patches is rare, and seasonal use of the patches by Native people before 1910 is well documented, both historically and ethnographically, ignition by humans probably accounts for more than half of the pre-1910 fires recorded in cross-sections.},

It demonstrates in a series of international case studies how to combine the more production-oriented focus of the agronomist with the more systems-oriented viewpoint of the ecologist. Different methodologies for quantifying and evaluating agroecosystem sustainability are presented and analyzed. Leading researchers in the field provide examples of the diversity and complexity of agroecological research, ranging from archeology to insect ecology, and examine design and management of agroecosystems that span from the humid tropics to temperate regions. This timely overview will be of great value to ecologists, agronomists, geographers, foresters, anthropologists, and others involved in developing a sustainable basis for land use, management, and conservation worldwide. ***RS-ENDE*** RS 11/89 PREX ***RS-NOTIZEN*** NY/Dr. Czeschlik},

	abstract = {Western lifestyles differ markedly from those of our hunter-gatherer ancestors, and these differences in diet and activity level are often implicated in the global obesity pandemic. However, few physiological data for hunter-gatherer populations are available to test these models of obesity. In this study, we used the doubly-labeled water method to measure total daily energy expenditure (kCal/day) in Hadza hunter-gatherers to test whether foragers expend more energy each day than their Western counterparts. As expected, physical activity level, PAL, was greater among Hadza foragers than among Westerners. Nonetheless, average daily energy expenditure of traditional Hadza foragers was no different than that of Westerners after controlling for body size. The metabolic cost of walking (kcal kg −1  m −1 ) and resting (kcal kg −1  s −1 ) were also similar among Hadza and Western groups. The similarity in metabolic rates across a broad range of cultures challenges current models of obesity suggesting that Western lifestyles lead to decreased energy expenditure. We hypothesize that human daily energy expenditure may be an evolved physiological trait largely independent of cultural differences.},

	abstract = {During late winter and spring, hunter-gatherers in temperate, subarctic, and arctic environments often relied on diets that provided marginal or inadequate caloric intakes. During such periods, particularly when stored food supplies dwindled or were used up entirely, lean meat became the principal source of energy. Nutritional problems associated with high-protein, low-energy diets are discussed. These problems include elevated metabolic rates, with correspondingly higher caloric requirements, and deficiencies in essential fatty acids. The relative benefits of adding fat or carbohydrate to a diet of lean meat are evaluated in light of the protein-sparing capacities of these two nutrients. Experimental data indicate that although both enhance high-protein, low-energy diets, carbohydrate is a more effective supplement than fat. Given the nutritional inadequacies of a lean-meat diet, the paper concludes with a discussion of alternative subsistence strategies that increase the availability of carbohydrate or fat at the critical time of year.},

	abstract = {Fire largely determined the composition and structure of the presettlement vegetation of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area as well as the vegetation mosaic on the landscape and the habitat patterns for wildlife. It also influenced nutrient cycles, and energy pathways, and helped maintain the diversity, productivity, and long-term stability of the ecosystem. Thus the whole ecosystem was fire-dependent. At least some overstory elements in virtually all forest stands still date from regeneration that followed one or more fires since 1595 A.D. The average interval between significant fire years was about 4 yr in presettlement times, but shortened to 2 yr from 1868 to 1910 during settlement. However, 83\% of the area burned before the beginning of suppression programs resulted from just nine fire periods: 1894, 1875, 1863–1964, 1824, 1801, 1755–1959, 1727, 1692, 1681. The average interval between these major fire years was 26 yr. Most present virgin forests date from regeneration that followed fires in these years. Significant areas were also regenerated by fires in 1903, 1910, 1936, and 1971. Most major fire years occurred during prolonged summer droughts of subcontinental extent, such as those of 1864, 1910, and 1936. Many fires were man-caused, but lightning ignitions were also common. Lightning alone is probably a sufficient source of ignitions to guarantee that older stands burned before attaining climax. Dry matter accumulations, spruce budworm outbreaks, blowdowns, and other interactions related to time since fire increase the probability that old stands will burn. Vegetation patterns on the landscape were influenced by such natural firebreaks as lakes, streams, wetlands, and moist slopes. Red and white pine are most common on islands, and to the east, northeast, or southeast of such firebreaks. Jack pine, aspen-birch, and sprout hardwood forests are most common on large uplands distant from or west of such firebreaks. A Natural Fire Rotation of about 100 yr prevailed in presettlement times, but many red and white pine stands remained largely intact for 150–350 yr, and some jack pine and aspen-birch forests probably burned at intervals of 50 yr or less. There is paleoecological evidence that fire was an ecosystem factor before European man arrived, and even before early man migrated to North America. Probably few areas ever attained the postulated fir-spruce-cedar-birch climax in postglacial times. To understand the dynamics of fire-dependent ecosystems fire must be studied as an integral part of the system. The search for stable communities that might develop without fire is futile and avoids the real challenge of understanding nature on her own terms. To restore the natural ecosystem of the Canoe Area fire should soon be reintroduced through a program of prescribed fires and monitored lightning fires. Failing this, major unnatural, perhaps unpredictable, changes in the ecosystem will occur.},

The number of annual wild-fires in the 550,000 hectare Pine Barrens has remained at approximately 1100 since 1940 when fire control became effective. The total area burned annually dropped sharply from about 22,000 ha during 1906-1939 to 8,000 ha in the past four decades. Extensive wildfires of 8,000-16,000 ha each are common. Since 1838, about every two decades on the average, 10\% or more of the predominant pine and oak forest burns in a single year (50,000 ha). An average point in the pine and oak forest burns currently at about 65 year intervals, compared with 20 year intervals earlier this century. The number of wildfires in the region correlates linearly with the number of dry months in a year. However, the area burned annually is constant with up to four dry months during the January-to-September period; both average and variability of area burned increases with five or more dry months. The results suggest the upland Pine Barrens are a mosaic of fire-caused patches at two levels of scale: a fine-grained scale of small (averaging 6 ha) young patches imprinted on a coarse-grained scale of large (several tens of ha), variable-sized patches more than four decades old. The drop in point fire frequency favors (a) non fire-adapted populations, (b) hardwoods swamp replacing cedar swamp, and (c) loss of the coarsegrained landscape mosaic.},

Over the last two decades, however, a contrary vision has emerged, one which sees the country's roots not in a state of "pristine" nature but rather in a "human-modified landscape" over which native peoples exerted vast control. Fire, Native Peoples, and the Natural Landscape seeks a middle ground between those conflicting paradigms, offering a critical, research-based assessment of the role of Native Americans in modifying the landscapes of pre-European America. Contributors focus on the western United States and look at the question of fire regimes, the single human impact which could have altered the environment at a broad, landscape scale, and which could have been important in almost any part of the West. Each of the seven chapters is written by a different author about a different subregion of the West, evaluating the question of whether the fire regimes extant at the time of European contact were the product of natural factors or whether ignitions by Native Americans fundamentally changed those regimes. An Introductory essay offers context for the regional chapters, and a concluding section compares results from the various regions and highlights patterns both common to the West as a whole and distinctive for various parts of the western states. The final section also relates the findings to policy questions concerning the management of natural areas, particularly on federal lands, and of the "naturalness" of the pre-European western landscape.},

	abstract = {Critical review of explanations for patterns of natural succession suggests a strong, common basis for theoretical understanding, but also suggests that several well known models are incomplete as explanations of succession. A universal, general cause for succession is unlikely, since numerous aspects of historical and environmental circumstances will impinge on the process in a unique manner. However, after disturbance, occupation of a site by any species causes changes in the conditions at the site. Sorting of species may result, since different species are adapted to different regions of environmental gradients. Such sorting can generate several patterns of species abundance in time, but commonly results in sequential replacements of species adapted to the varying conditions. This may be due to constraints on species' strategies, or life history traits, placed by the limited resources available to the organism. These constraints often result in inverse correlation between traits which confer success during early and late stages of succession. Facilitatory or inhibitory effects of species on each other are best understood in terms of these life history interactions, perhaps as restrictions on, or as moderation of, these process. Strong support for the importance of correlations in life history traits stems from comparisons of simulated succession with and without these correlations. These simulations are reviewed in some detail, and followed by brief reviews of other prominent models for succession. Several aspects of the confusion and controversies in the successional literature are then discussed, with a view to a more optimistic synthesis and direction for successional ecology.},

	abstract = {We describe and apply a correspondence between two major modeling approaches to forest dynamics: transition markovian models and gap models or JABOWA-FORET type simulators. A transition model can be derived from a gap model by defining states on the basis of species, functional roles, vertical structure, or other convenient cover types. A gap-size plot can be assigned to one state according to dominance of one of these cover types. A semi-Markov framework is used for the transition model by considering not only the transition probabilities among the states, but also the holding times in each transition. The holding times are considered to be a combination of distributed and fixed time delays. Spatial extensions are possible by considering collections of gap-size plots and the proportions of these plots occupied by each state. The advantages of this approach include: reducing simulation time, analytical guidance to the simulations, direct analytical exploration of hypothesis and the possibility of fast computation from closed-form solutions and formulae. These advantages can be useful in the simulation of landscape dynamics and of species-rich forests, as well as in designing management strategies. A preliminary application to the H. J. Andrews forest in the Oregon Cascades is presented for demonstration.},

We analyzed the structural response of woody plants to long-term experimental burning in savannas. The experiment uses a randomized block design to examine fire exclusion and the season and frequency of burn in 192 7-ha experimental plots located in four different savanna ecosystems. Although previous studies would lead us to expect tree density to respond to the fire regime, our results, obtained from four different savanna ecosystems, suggest that the density of woody individuals was unresponsive to fire. The relative dominance of small trees was, however, highly responsive to fire regime. The observed shift in the structure of tree populations has potentially large impacts on the carbon balance. However, the response of tree biomass to fire of the different savannas studied were different, making it difficult to generalize about the extent to which fire can be used to manipulate carbon sequestration in savannas. This study provides evidence that savannas are demographically resilient to fire, but structurally responsive.},

In fall of 1955, these colonies were trapped to extirpation to obtain accurate counts and colony compositions. I established photo stations and took a series of photographs approximately every 5 years, in late September, from 1955 to 2005 to document beaver-population dynamics and beaver-pond successional changes after complete beaver removal. The number and configuration of dams, ponds, and canals remained remarkably similar, with maintenance conducted by succeeding generations of beaver. Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and autumn willow (Salix serissima) boundaries also remained stable, but conifers slowly encroached. At 3 of 4 colony sites, beaver did not attempt to construct food caches for overwintering. By fall of 2005, the fourth site was also without a cache. Carrying capacity of these areas was likely limited by severe winter weather at 2,620-m to 2,900-m elevations, aspen depletion, pond-depth reduction, and sustained grazing by cattle. Although beaver carefully maintained dams, pond depths were reduced in most cases. This slow transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial system is a natural progression in this region.},

We initiated this study to develop proactive and long-term approaches to deal with nuisance beaver along roadsides. From June to October 1997 and 1998, we sampled 316 roadside sites in New York state, USA—216 sites where beaver occupied the roadside area and 100 unoccupied sites. We used stepwise logistic regression to identify habitat variables associated with beaver occupancy along roadsides. We evaluated regression models through measures of sensitivity and specificity. The logistic function retained the percentage of roadside area devoid of woody vegetation, stream gradient, the interaction between these 2 variables, and stream width in the final model. Precluding beaver occupancy along highways would necessarily involve large-scale removal of woody vegetation that would be impractical in all but the most intensive management scenarios. However, beaver habitat assessment adjacent to roads may be a useful tool for designing new highways, prioritizing culvert replacements, and developing proactive plans for beaver damage management.},

This paper analyzes the fate of beaver ponds mapped in 1868 near Ishpeming, Michigan, USA. Of the 64 beaver dam and pond sites mapped in the 1860s, 72 \% were still discernible in 2014. Land use changes that altered the terrain (mining, residential development) or stream paths (channelization) were the main sources of beaver pond loss. This remarkable consistency in beaver pond placement over the last 150 years is evidence of the beaver’s resilience.},

Ecosystem engineering – the physical modification of habitats by organisms – has been proposed as an important mechanism for maintaining high species richness at the landscape scale by increasing habitat heterogeneity. Dams built by beaver (Castor canadensis) dramatically alter riparian landscapes throughout much of North America. In the central Adirondacks, New York, USA, ecosystem engineering by beaver leads to the formation of extensive wetland habitat capable of supporting herbaceous plant species not found elsewhere in the riparian zone. We show that by increasing habitat heterogeneity, beaver increase the number of species of herbaceous plants in the riparian zone by over 33\% at a scale that encompasses both beaver-modified patches and patches with no history of beaver occupation. We suggest that ecosystem engineers will increase species richness at the landscape scale whenever there are species present in a landscape that are restricted to engineered habitats during at least some stages of their life cycle.},

The data were elaborated using direct and indirect gradient analyses. Alterations of environmental factors (moisture, nitrogen) were expressed using Ellenberg's indicator values. Over most of the area, the former distinct vegetation mosaic has been replaced by uniform meadows due to intensive farming. The area was eutrophicated and partly drained, clearly shown in Ellenberg's indicator values, in species composition and vegetation pattern. Rapid processes of ruderalization took place. A scheme of successional pathways which finally emerged can be applied to analogous wet meadows in comparable geographical regions and used as a tool for prognoses of successional processes in meadows under human impact.

	abstract = {Canopy gaps in a second growth forest in East Tennessee were studied to document succession, sapling species partitioning in individual gaps and possible sapling adaptations for gap colonization. Ten gaps (64 to 309 m2, mean = 186 m2) and four closed canopy plots (200 m2 each) were surveyed. All trees were identified and located, extension growth of the leader stem of saplings (n = 933) was measured and diameter at breast height (dbh) of trees {\textgreater} 3 m tall (n = 504) was measured. Sapling composition in gaps was dominated by Fagus grandifolia Ehrh., Acer rubrum L. and A. saccharum Marsh., indicating that several species in the current canopy, dominated by Quercus spp, Pinus spp, Liriodendron tulipifera L. and F. grandifolia Ehrh., will eventually be replaced. There was little evidence of within gap partitioning either between the north and south portions of gaps or between their centers and edges, perhaps due to a history of instability in disturbance regimes. All three dominant sapling species showed significantly greater extension growth in gaps than in closed forest. Acer rubrum grew significantly less in gaps than A. saccharum. Under closed canopy this result was reversed, suggesting that while A. saccharum may be better adapted to using gaps, A. rubrum may grow better beneath the canopy.},

	abstract = {The post-glacial history of a marl and peat marsh contained evidence that early hydrarch succession may have been relatively rapid due to higher plant as well as invertebrate animal productivity. Pristine open marsh, sedge meadow, and wet prairie were held in quasi-equilibrium by alternations of floods during wet periods and fires during drought. Fires either checked terrestrial advancement or turned it back to earlier aquatic stages by organic substrate removal. Recent fire control and continued lowering of water levels hastened intermediate hydrarch succession by quickly and directly converting aquatic to terrestrial sites. A peat burn increased soil pH and soil nutrients, particularly the phosphates, and eliminated plant competition so that open marsh was immediately invaded by aspen forest, which if uninterrupted, will be converted to lowland hardwood forest. Recurring fires could perpetuate the sucker-sprouting aspen, but burning decadent aspen forest might originate true prairie. Although fire is usually catastrophic and retrogressive, it produced successional stability and even acted as a successional accelerator in this lowland.},

	abstract = {This report is part of a series of profiles on the ecology of wetland and deepwater habitats. This particular profile addresses red maple swamps in the glaciated northeastern United States. Red maple (Acer rubrum) swamp is a dominant wetland type in most of the region; it reaches its greatest abundance in southern New England and northern New Jersey, where it comprises 60-800/o of all inland wetlands. Red maple swamps occur in a wide variety of hydrogeologic settings, from small, isolated basins in till or glaciofluvial deposits to extensive wetland complexes on glacial lake beds, and from hillside seeps to stream floodplains and lake edges. Individual swamps may be seasonally flooded, temporarily flooded, or seasonally saturated, and soils may be mineral or organic. As many as five distinct vegetation layers may occur in these swamps, including trees, saplings, shrubs, herbs, and ground cover plants such as bryophytes and clubmosses. On a regional scale, red maple swamps support at least 50 species of trees, more than 90 species of shrubs and vines, and more than 300 species of nonwoody plants. These swamps also provide habitat for a rich faunal community, including several wetland-dependent species. In areas that are becoming urbanized, these wetlands often constitute critical habitat for facultative species as well. Red maple swamps also are important sites for flood storage, water quality improvement, recreation, scenic beauty, and open space.},
